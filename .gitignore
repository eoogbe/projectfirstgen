# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log
/tmp

# Ignore Sass cache
.sass-cache

# Ignore Rspec state persistence
spec/examples.txt

# These shouldn't be here but I can't think of a good place to put them
credentials.txt
